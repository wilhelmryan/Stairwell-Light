# Stairwell-Light
PIR/'duino motion sensor light

Uses an HC-SR501 Infrared PIR Motion Sensor and compatible AVR microcontroller (in this case, Arduino) to have a softstart and ramping down light. 

Adjustable paramaters include length of ramp (amount of time from zero to max PWM), max duty cycle (PWM for led brightness control), and light timeout. 

This will eventually be turned into a libary.
